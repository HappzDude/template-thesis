\chapter{Introduction}
Nowerdays its very Common in IT to have Distributed Systems in Location all over the Globe. To be able to provide the best user Experience its important to Monitor these Networks by only few People sitting in one or more Location. Important here is the Availability and Reliability also as the Response Time of the System. 

To tackle these kinds of Tasks Application Performance Management Tool were build. They are available in a wide range of Costs and Qualities. They differ a lot in their Architecture and style of tackling Problems. This is why we decided to make a Comparison of some large Open-Source tool stacks available on the Market 


\section*{Thesis Structure}
In the first part the Paper describes the general aspects of Monitoring and the general Metrics. The part also discusses the characteristics of the environments and their special interfaces. After the introduction the tools will be introduced on there own. 
\begin{description}
\item[Technical Details:] In this chapter all technical aspects of the Test environments and Tools will be explained. Also the Term Stack will be illustrated.  
\item[Collectors:] Explains all details and methods of the client based tools.
\item[Database:] Analyzes the different types of Methods of Storing Time related Data
\item[Visualizaion:] Illustrates how time related data can be presented in general and which Visual limitation to tackle  \\
\item[Alerting:] Here the different Approaches and methods to inform the User/Administrator about any Problems are discussed 
\\
\item[InfluxData:] Company that was Founded 2012 and Provides a Full Stack Open-Source APM tool.
\item[Elastic:] The Elasticsearch BV provides a tool stack of APM tools. In the middle of this stack is the Elasticsearch Application which is a searching engine written in Java. 
\item[Prometeus:]Prometheus is a Open-Source Tool stack for monitoring and alerting, with focus on reliability and simplicity.
\item[Zabbix:]Zabbix is an open source monitoring software for networks and applications for enterprise use
\section*{Goals}
Goal of the Study is to print out the benefits and disadvantages of the popular Open-Source Tools and Stacks Available on the Market. The work wants to Illustrate the features and technologies of the tools to make it easier for the Reader to get an overview over the different Software approaches. In particular the tools will be tested in their ability to interact with modern Cloud technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. Furthermore they will be compared by their Ability to integrate in existing environments and support of common tools and Interfaces. Moreover the Cross Compatibility of the stacks will be tested to get the best out of the tool pool.a
