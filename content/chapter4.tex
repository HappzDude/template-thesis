This chapter deals with the comparison of the tools grouped by their responsibility. First, we explain some concepts, we have encountered in our research. These concepts will be covered in \cref{concepts}.
Each table shows the specification the developer gives. They are ordered by the responsibility of tools. The information shown in the tables are from the website of the tool providers.
In all tables below we indicated present features with a $ \checkmark $ and non-present features with a $ X $, if they were advertised by the developer.
\section{Comparison of concepts}
\label{concepts}
In the scope of this study we identified concepts to group the tools by comparison. Most of them are self explanatory. The ones that are not self explanatory are listed below with a brief introduction.
\subsection{Push/Pull}
\label{push/pull}
There are two basic concepts of the exchange of informations between the collector and the database. Hereby referred as push and pull. Push \cite{5557986} is a concept, were the collector  automatically starts sending data to the database as soon the system is started. The data is send continuously. Important is that the collector knows or discovers the data destination, mostly through the use of a discoverer.
Pull \cite{5557986} on the other hand means that the database sends requests to all active nodes. These requests are executed in certain intervals. These intervals can be modified and adjusted according to the system requirements. In this concept the database needs a discoverer to find all existing nodes
\subsection{REST}
\label{rest}
Representational State Transfer is a programming paradigm for distributed systems. It describes a way, how services in special web services interact with each other. Important concepts of REST are loose coupling, interoperability and scalability. Any data in REST is made persistent in resources. These resources are addressable over an Uniform Resource Identifier. \\
To make an interface RESTful, it has to provide all HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, OPTIONS within a well known data format as XML or JSON \cite{tilkov2015rest}.


\section{Collector}
The \cref{tab:Collector} compares the different collector tools tested in this paper. The tools are compared by RESTful (\cref{rest}), Multiple(Multi.) Input Formats, Plug-ins for own data and Push/Pull (\cref{push/pull}).
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\hline

Tool & RESTful & Multi. Input Formats      & Plug-ins for own data        & Push / Pull \\

\hline
Telegraf    & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes    & Yes    &Pull    ($ \checkmark $)  \\
Beats  & Yes ($ \checkmark $)  & Yes & Yes  & Push ($ \checkmark $) \\
Logstash & Yes ($ \checkmark $)  & No & Yes & Push/Pull($\checkmark$)                         \\
Icinga2  & No  & No  & Yes  & Push \\
Prometheus  & No  & No  & Yes  & Pull ($ \checkmark $)/ Push\\
Zabbix & No  & No  & No  & Both \\
\hline                        
\end{tabular}

\label{tab:Collector}
\end{table}

\section{Database}
\cref{tab:Database} shows the databases. First we checked if the tools have an authentication-based asses to  the content. Furthermore we have selected the tools according to time-series-database and in addition to that, we checked, if multiple datasets per time stamp are allowed. 
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
	\hline
Tool & Database-Authentication     & Time-Series-Database          & Multi. Data Points        \\
\hline
InfluxDB  & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $)  & Yes ($ \checkmark $)\\
Elasticsearch & https ($ \checkmark $), credentials ($ X $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $)\\
Icinga2 & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $) \\
Prometheus& No & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $)\\
Zabbix& Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $)\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Database-table - All tested database tools are listed and compared}
\label{tab:Database}
\end{table}

\section{Visualization}
\cref{tab:Visualization} compares the different visualization tools. One aspect is the security of the tool, this is compared by LDAP-Authentication (\cref{ldap}). In general the tools are tested on the base of the graphs that they can display. We tested if they are scalable and whether or not it is possible to show multiple data streams in one graph. 
\begin{table}[H] 
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
	\hline
Tool & LDAP-Authentication         & Scalable graphs             & Overlapping graphs          \\
\hline
Chronograf & No & Yes & Yes \\
Kibana & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $)\\
Grafana & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $)\\
Zabbix & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $)  & Yes  ($ \checkmark $)\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Visualization-table - All tested visualization tools are listed and compared}

\end{table}

\section{Alerting}
The last two tables (\cref{tab:Alerting}) and (\cref{tab:Alertingcont}) compares the altering tools. These tools were tested if they can send HTTP requests. Moreover, when many identical alerts arrive, whether they are groupable. Furthermore we tested the most common messaging tools for sending alerts and if the tools offer an interface to integrate any third-party-tool for messaging. Finally, the tools have been tested for triggering events like scripts when an alert is received.
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
		\hline
Tool & HTTP requests & Grouping of alerts & E-Mail & Messangers \\
\hline
Kapacitor & Yes  & No & Yes & Yes \\
Elastalert & No & No & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $) \\
Grafana & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $) \\
Zabbix & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ \checkmark $) \\
Prometheus & Yes ($ \checkmark $) & Yes ($ X $) & Yes ($ X $) & Yes ($ X $)\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
