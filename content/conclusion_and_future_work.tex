\section{General Trends}
Most of the systems we evaluated or considered evaluating were metric monitoring stacks. In general most tools detect not the cause of the failure. Instead the effect is recognized and can be treated many manualy. With some tools we saw a trend towards more automation. These tools had functions like automated script triggering over ssh or automatic delivery of logs in the alert message. \\
\\
Another trend is that alerting manager implement a massive amount of different services for messaging that are used by modern developer teams like slack or telegram. Some of the bigger tools were also capable of REST or SOAP requests so that nearly every interface can be included. To keep overview of cascading failure ,some of the tools can group errors to one alert.
\\
In Visualization a big trend is the presentation of similar data in one single graph. These method provides a better overview of the system and leads to generalization of the data. Moreover the most tools use coloring to highlight warnings or errors. The big player on the market also implement a custom ordering engine, to drag around the graphs for an own sorting.
\\
We also saw some tendency in the database evolution. Databases are no longer just for storing single data points. They now have a greater added value by implementing there own querying language. Using this to purify the collected the data for visualization tools. The most established data format is JSON because the files can be fragmented over multiple nodes.

The field of collectors drifts towards multi functional interfaces. These trend is settled, because many system have to be integrated in already existing monitoring environments.
