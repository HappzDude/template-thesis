\section{General Trends}
Most of the systems we evaluated, or considered evaluating were metric monitoring stacks. In general most tools detect not the cause of the failure. Instead the effect is recognized and can be treated many manualy. With some tools we saw a trend towards more automation. These tools had functions like automated script triggering over ssh or automatic delivery of logs in the alert message. \\
\\
Another trend is that alerting manager implement a massive amount of different services for messaging that are hip like slack or telegram. Some of the bigger tools were also capable of REST or SOAP requests so that neary every interface can be included.
\\
In Visualisation a big trend is the presentation of similar data in one singel graph. These method provides a better overview of the system and leads to generalization of the data.
